# hello-world
This is my introduction to GitHub.
I am taking 12 credit hours this semester and I'm really just trying to stay afloat right now. I have 3 8-week courses, one 16-week course, a 2-year-old daughter who (understandably) demands much of my spare time, and I'm the primary breadwinner for my family. I decided to enroll in Computer Science so that I could make better money and not have to work so many hours, and right now I'm just trying to make it through the next 4-5 weeks so that everything slows down a little bit. I'm not even sure I'm going to be any good at coding, because I don't have the time to study it any further than just doing the bare minimum of work that's due at any given time.
